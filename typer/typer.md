# Type checking in JavaScript
Sometimes it could be a good thing to check if an object is of a type T. Lets see this example:

```
function doStuff(thing) {
  return thing.map(function(item) {
    return item * 2;
  });
}
```

If we call this function with an array, we get the expected result
```
doStuff([1,2,3]) //Array [ 2, 4, 6 ]
```
But if someone calls doStuff with a different type of argument, it will throw an exception, because most likely the argument object won't have a method map defined on it.
```
doStuff(3) //TypeError: thing.map is not a function
```
Apart from this, having methods like isArray, or isString can rise readability when validating input arguments, and clears things up for fellow co-workers.

Your task will be to create a basic type-checker "framework/api" for JavaScript. Let's call it typer.js. Your API must contain the following methods:

```
isNumber
isString
isArray
isFunction
isDate
isRegExp
isBoolean
isError
isNull
isUndefined
```
Create these utility methods for input validation. For example, if the argument is a number, then isNumber called with this argument should return true.

## Example
```
assert.equal(typer.isNumber(5), true);
assert.equal(typer.isString({}), false);
```
## Note
If you are stuck, feel free to check how known utility libraries do the exact same thing. Check them on GitHub ;)

## Motivation
Possibly after this kata the warriors who just started to learn JavaScript will learn that sometimes the conventional ways of type checking in JavaScript in not sufficient enough, since, for example, not only "simple" numbers are considered as numbers, but numbers created by Number constructors, etc.
