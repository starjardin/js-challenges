### Task:
So the task here is to implement a function called `id`  that takes a string, c_str, and returns a string with the case the input is in. The possible case types are “kebab”, “camel”, and ”snake”. If none of the cases match with the input, or if there are no 'spaces' in the input (for example in snake case, spaces would be '_'s), return “none”. Inputs will only have letters (no numbers or special characters).
